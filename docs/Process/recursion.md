- ðŸ“– **Definition**: Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems of the original problem.
- ðŸ’» **Example in `fastcubo`**:
  - Functions like `computePixels_np` and `getPixels_np` use recursion to split large images into manageable parts, downloading them in batches.
